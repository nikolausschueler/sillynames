### What is it? ###

This is a little demo of how to testing with Selenium
(https://www.seleniumhq.org/). The app presents names which are presumed to be
funny.

It was created as a demo for an article in German computer magazine c't:

Klickroboter. Automatisches Testen mit Selenium, c't 11/18, Heise Verlag.

### How do I get set up? ###

1. Install the Chrome browser. You can get it here:
  https://www.google.com/chrome.
1. Install Chromedriver, as described here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
1. Set up the Virtualenv with `make venv`.
1. Activate it with `source venv/bin/activate`
1. Install needed packages with `make pip`
1. Run the tests with `make test`

### Docker issues ###

This also contains a Dockerfile. With this, you can create a Docker image, run
it and access the app from your host. But the Docker setup can not run the
tests, there is a problem with PhantomJS that prevents this. Although it looks
like you can install PhantomJS with Node/Npm, I couldn't set it up so the tests
could be run.
